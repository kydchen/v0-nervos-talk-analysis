## 📖 Overview / 简介

**Nervos Intel Analyzer** is an AI-powered governance auxiliary tool designed for the Nervos CKB community. It tackles the challenge of "Information Overload" in DAO governance by parsing long forum threads into high-fidelity summaries and interactive social graphs.

This tool is **NOT** a decision-maker; it is an **"Intelligence Staff Officer" (情报参谋)**. It helps community members verify facts, visualize influence structures, and lower the cognitive barrier to entry.

## ✨ Key Features / 核心功能

### 🤖 1. Bias-Resistant AI Analysis (抗偏见 AI 分析)
* **Cognitive Decoupling**: The AI engine is engineered with **"Identity Blindness"**. It evaluates arguments strictly based on logic and evidence (e.g., on-chain data, historical RFCs), explicitly ignoring user titles (Admin/Mod) during the analysis phase.
* **Role Scoping**: Administrative titles are only mentioned if specific moderation actions (e.g., thread locking) occurred.
* **Click-to-Verify**: Every AI claim is anchored with a smart citation `(Floor X)`. Click to jump directly to the original post. **"Don't Trust, Verify."**

### 🕸️ 2. Social Graph 2.0 (交互式社交图谱)
* **AI Personas (God Mode)**: Hover over any node to see an **AI-generated Persona Card**. It summarizes that user's stance in one sentence (e.g., *"Skeptical about budget due to lack of technical details"*).
* **Equal Mode (Default)**: Visualizes the community under a "Veil of Ignorance". All nodes are unified in blue; size reflects activity only. This nudges observers to judge influence by engagement, not status.
* **Reveal Roles Toggle**: Optional mode to overlay administrative hierarchy (🔴 Admin, 🟢 Mod) for power structure auditing.
* **Spotlight Interaction**: Hovering dims noise and highlights the user's **"Influence Network"** (incoming likes) in gold.

### 📊 3. Deep Integration
* **Timeline Analysis**: Temporal distribution of posts and sentiments.
* **Raw Data Access**: Full access to the raw post list with role labels for manual verification.

## 🛠️ Design Philosophy / 设计哲学

This tool implements concepts from **Behavioral Economics** and **Political Philosophy** to foster rational deliberation:

1.  **Nudging (Thaler & Sunstein)**: By defaulting the graph to "Equal Mode", we nudge users away from the "Halo Effect" of high-level titles.
2.  **Information Hierarchy**: 
    * *Layer 1 (Synthesis)*: AI Report (Logic & Arguments)
    * *Layer 2 (Perception)*: Social Graph (Topology & Influence)
    * *Layer 3 (Verification)*: Raw Post List (Context & Reputation)
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI is used to quantify qualitative metrics (like "Inclusion"), but the human user always retains final judgment.
